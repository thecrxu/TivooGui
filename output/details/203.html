</tr><tr><td>The community group Religious Coalition for a Nonviolent Durham seeks to mourn with families of murder victims through prayer vigils and also befriend people in prison who have committed murders and other violent crimes. The dean of Duke Chapel, Samuel Wells, says the group's approach to reconciliation and healing within a community embodies much of what Christian ministry should be about. During a live, interactive webcast, Wells will answer your questions about how communities can respond to violence, and what Jesus has to do with it. He will be joined by the director of the Religious Coalition for a Nonviolent Durham, Marcia A. Owen, a Duke alumna and coauthor with Wells of the new book &quot;Living Without Enemies.&quot; To ask Wells and Owen a question, send an email to live@duke.edu, tweet with the tag #dukelive or post to the Duke University Facebook page at www.facebook.com/DukeUniversity.</td></tr><tr><td class="back"><a href="../../output/testhtml.html">Back to summary</a></td></tr></table></body></html>
