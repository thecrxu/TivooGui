</tr><tr><td>&quot;Aftershock&quot; (Xiaogang Feng, 2010, 135 min, China, Mandarin with English subtitles, Color, 35mm)-- Acclaimed director Feng Xiaogang's AFTERSHOCK is an epic drama sweeping across three decades and two devastating earthquakes, 1976 in Tangshan and 2008 in Sichuan province. As dramatized in the novel by Chinese Canadian author Zhang Ling, the story shows the pain and resilience of a family decimated by loss, exploring themes of survival, family relationships, guilt and post-traumatic stress. Director Feng paints an emotional epic with potent strokes of truth, bringing to life a new model of disaster cinema that is intimate, choral and uniquely Chinese. -- The highest-grossing domestic film in China's history! -- China's entry for the 2010 foreign-language Oscar! -- Best Film/Best Actor at the 2010 Asia Pacific Screen Awards, Best Actress at the 2010 Asian Film Awards. Part of the Cine-East film series. [Actor Yang Lixin will also visit Duke, on Thu 9/29 - event details TBA.]</td></tr><tr><td class="back"><a href="../../output/testhtml.html">Back to summary</a></td></tr></table></body></html>
