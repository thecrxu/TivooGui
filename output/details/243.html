<table width="70%" align="center"><tr><th colspan="2" class="title">Duke Storm Water Seminar</th>
</tr><tr><td>The State of North Carolina recently adopted rules to reduce nutrient pollution in both Jordan and Falls lakes. Duke University, which has portions of its East, West and Central campus in the Upper Cape Fear River and Upper Neuse River watersheds that encompass the lakes has since been proactive in finding ways to comply with these rules.

Hear Steve Palumbo, Duke's Energy Manager for the Facilities Management Department, discuss the University's efforts to manage storm water pollution, to meet and exceed state and local standards, and to begin capturing and reusing rain water as a resource at the Duke Storm Water Seminar.

This event, hosted by the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions, is free and open to the public.</td></tr><tr><td class="back"><a href="../../output/testhtml.html">Back to summary</a></td></tr></table></body></html>
