</tr><tr><td>Film Screening: STALKER (Andrei Tarkovsky, 1979, 160 min, Soviet Union, in Russian w/ subtitles, Color, 35mm) -- A powerful and haunting sci-fi parable imbued by Tarkovsky with a multi-layered visual resonance and, despite its stately pace, raw emotional impact. Near a gray and unnamed city is the Zone, an alien place guarded by barbed wire and soldiers. Over his wife's numerous objections, a man rises in the dead of night: he's a stalker, one of a handful who have the mental gifts (and who risk imprisonment) to lead people into the Zone to the Room, a place where one's secret hopes come true. That night, he takes two people into the Zone: a popular writer who is burned out, cynical, and questioning his genius; and a quiet scientist more concerned about his knapsack than the journey. -- Received a special award, &quot;the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury,&quot; at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival!</td></tr><tr><td class="back"><a href="../../output/testhtml.html">Back to summary</a></td></tr></table></body></html>
