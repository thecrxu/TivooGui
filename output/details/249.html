</tr><tr><td>Duke Med Elementary, affiliated with GPSC and originating from Duke Medical School, is a dynamic service club that aims to teach local 3rd grade students the importance of healthy lifestyles. We will cover curriculum on the cardiovascular system (with a pig heart dissection!) in the fall. This is a one hour lunch with a local elementary school in Durham. Through this program, we hope to spark interest in the health sciences and encourage these young-ens to pursue higher levels of education.

Activities will include lunch, lecture, and small group activities.</td></tr><tr><td class="back"><a href="../../output/testhtml.html">Back to summary</a></td></tr></table></body></html>
