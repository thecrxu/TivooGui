<table width="70%" align="center"><tr><th colspan="2" class="title">Duke Campus Farm Workday</th>
</tr><tr><td>Head to the Duke Campus Farm this fall for public workdays every Thursday from 4-7pm and Sunday from 10am-2pm. Throughout the fall, volunteers will be planting, harvesting, weeding and working on small construction projects. Everyone is welcome, including children and those without any background in farming or gardening. It's a great opportunity to learn how food is grown, meet others from the Duke community who are interested in food, and spend some time outside. Be sure to check this website for workday updates in case of bad weather before heading to the farm: http://sites.google.com/site/dukecampusfarm. 
Carpooling is available, please email me or dukecampusfarm@gmail.com to request a ride. The Duke Campus Farm is located at 5082 Friends School Rd in Durham, directly across the street from Carolina Friends School in the Duke Forest.
