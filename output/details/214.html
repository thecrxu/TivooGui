</tr><tr><td>LaTeX is becoming the most widely used document processing system in the social sciences with good reason: it generates publication quality documents, allows for precise mathematical notation and equations, has a built in citation manager and it is FREE.

No previous knowledge of LaTeX or programming is needed.</td></tr><tr><td class="back"><a href="../../output/testhtml.html">Back to summary</a></td></tr></table></body></html>
