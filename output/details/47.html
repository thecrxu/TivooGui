</tr><tr><td>Controversy, conflict, and disagreement are integral elements of college teaching. Instructors can use
controversy deliberately, through a system of intentional engagement, to promote critical thinking in
students. In this workshop, participants will consider ways to anticipate controversy and use it
productively, through a repertoire of approaches that avoid antagonism and promote engagement.</td></tr><tr><td class="back"><a href="../../output/testhtml.html">Back to summary</a></td></tr></table></body></html>
